### Added
- sph: PCISPH pressure solver (`step_pcisph`) with iterative density-error correction

- coupling: `FlipSolver` grid dims are private with getters

- sph: Neighbor list caching via `query_cell` (zero per-particle allocation)
- sph: Surface tension via CSF model with poly6 gradient/laplacian kernels
- docs: Roadmap at `docs/development/roadmap.md`

### Changed
